# KEYWORDS

1. **OPERATING SYSTEM(OS)**: An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware

    these are the famous or commonly used Operating System(OS):

   WINDOWS

   MACos

   LINUX

3. **BARE METAL**: Bare metal refers to a computer system or servers that runs without a layer of abstraction such as a virtulization layer or operating system.
in this context, "bare metal" means the hardware is directly utilized for a single application or workload, allowing  for maximum performance and control

4. **LINUX KERNEL**: The linux kernal is the core component of the linux operating system. it serves as the fundamental interface between a computer's hardware and its software.
       Here are key aspects of the linux kernal:

   ~kernal functions: it manages hardware resources such as CPU,Memory, and peripheral devices.

   ~modularity: the linux kernal is modular, meaning it can be extended with loadable modules that can be added or removed at runtime.

   ~open source: the linux kernel is open source, released under the GNU General Public License(GPL). this means its source code is freely available for anyone to inspect,
     modify and distribute.

   ~device drivers: the kernel includes drivers for a wide range of hardware devices, enabling the operating system to communicateT with and control peripherals like printers
     network cards, and graphics adapters.
5. Devices are mainly divided into three parts:

 (i) **COMPUTATION**:-

   ~CPU:-The central processing unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing tasks.often
               to referred to as the "brain" of the computer, the CPU executes instruction from proggrams through its control unit, arthmetic logic unit(ALU),and registers.

   ~GPU:-A Gaphics processing unit(GPU) is a specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation. unlike a CPU,which is 
               optimised for general-purpose computing task, a GPU is optimized for parllel processing,meaning it can handle many operations simultaneously.

   ~TPU:-A tensor processing unit(TPU) is a specialized type of processor designed by google specifically for accelerating machine learning task,particularly those
               involving tensor computations. Tensor are multimensional arrays used in various machine learning and artificial intelligence models.

   ~QPU:-A quantum processing unit(QPU) is a spcialized type of processor designed to perform quantum computations. unlike classical processor, which use bits to represent 
               data as 0s and 1s, aQPU uses quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to quantum superposition.

   ~ASIC:-ASIC stands for Application-Specific integrated circuit. it's a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general
                puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.

   (ii) **STORAGE**:-

   ~primary storage: RAM

   ~secondary storage: hard disk

   (iii) **NETWORK**:-

  ~ Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN covers a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus. It connects devices within this limited space, typically using Ethernet                               cables or Wi-Fi. LANs are used for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet access.

  ~Wide Area Network (WAN): A WAN spans a large geographic area, often covering multiple cities, countries, or even continents. It connects multiple LANs and other types of                             networks. The internet is the largest example of a WAN. WANs can be public, like the internet, or private, like those used by large corporations.

  # OSI MODEL(7 LAYERS) NETWORKING MODEL

  The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a    telecommunication or computing system, regardless of its underlying technology. It divides network communication into seven distinct   layers, each with specific functions.

 # **BLOCKCHAIN:**

 Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across multiple computers in a way that       prevents alteration or tampering. It operates as a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. Once a block is added to   the chain, it is difficult to change any information in that block without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus  from the network. This makes blockchain a transparent and secure method for managing and verifying transactions. It's commonly used in  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but also has applications in various other fields, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and   smart contracts.
